Set of programs solving various real-world problems (with practical use-cases examples!)
 Practical Use Cases:
Content Moderation (e.g., YouTube or TikTok)

Several human reviewers flag content. Only responses from reliable reviewers are aggregated to decide whether to remove or keep content.

Medical Image Labeling

Radiologists or technicians annotate X-rays or MRIs. The system filters based on past accuracy and combines answers for AI training.

Survey Quality Control

In large-scale surveys (e.g., political polling), filter out low-effort or inconsistent respondents and aggregate reliable responses per question.

Product Review Tagging

Workers label reviews with sentiments or features. This script ensures only reliable workers influence the final tags.

Self-driving Car Datasets

Annotators tag traffic objects (pedestrians, lights, signs). This algorithm ensures faulty annotators don't skew the labels that will train driving models.
